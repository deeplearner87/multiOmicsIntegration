# Github Repository for multiOmics Integration project involving genomics, epigenomics and transcriptomics data (Version v1)
This repository contains codes for the collaborative project "Estimating gene expression from DNA methylation and copy number variation: A deep learning regression model for multi-omics integration", by Seal, Dibyendu, Das, Vivek, Goswami, Saptarshi, & De, Rajat. (2020) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888754319309449

The datasets used in the manuscript can be downloaded from Zenodo: http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3712496

Currently there are 3 Python notebooks in this Github repository:
1. `Pre-processing.ipynb`
2. `DNAm_CNA_to_RNAseq.ipynb`
3. `DNAm_to_CNA.ipynb`

The above notebooks can be used to run the codes used for multi-omics integration using Deep Learning and state-of-the-art regression methods.
